# üå©Ô∏è Module 2 ‚Äì Python Invocation Meets Cloud Breath

*From foundational syntax to orchestrating with AWS IAM and S3*

This module bridges the breath of local Python invocation with the rhythm of cloud orchestration. Learners revisit core syntax, then ascend into AWS rituals using `boto3`, all while honoring reproducibility and onboarding clarity.

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Refresh Python fundamentals with annotated examples  
- Invoke AWS IAM and S3 using `boto3`  
- Practice object-oriented design for cloud resources  
- Reinforce reproducibility with `.env`, `requirements.txt`, and commit rituals

## üß™ Practice Rituals

See [`learning_reinforcement/module2_practice.md`](learning_reinforcement/module2_practice.md) for hands-on tasks:
- Refresh syntax with civic metaphors
- Invoke AWS services using `boto3`
- Reflect and commit with poetic messages

---

## üßò Reflection & Stewardship

Use [`learning_reinforcement/learning_log.md`](learning_reinforcement/learning_log.md) to record:
- What surprised you?
- What errors taught you?
- What reproducibility fingerprint did you leave?

---

## ü™Ñ Devcontainer Setup

Launch in GitHub Codespaces or locally:
- Python 3.11 image
- Pre-installed: `boto3`, `requests`, `python-dotenv`
- VS Code extensions for formatting and linting

See [`devcontainer/devcontainer.json`](devcontainer/devcontainer.json) for details.

## üîê AWS Credential Setup

Create a `.env` file with your credentials:
```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
