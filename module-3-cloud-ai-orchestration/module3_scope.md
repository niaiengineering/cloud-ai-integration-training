# 🪔 Onboarding Guide: Cloud-AI Orchestration

Welcome, steward. This guide accompanies Module 3 and is designed to walk you through the integration of GenAI flows into cloud-native architectures. Each step is annotated with clarity, reproducibility, and reverence for future maintainers.

## 🧭 Orientation Ritual

Before you begin, pause and reflect:  
What civic question or enterprise challenge might your GenAI agent help answer?  
This module is not just technical—it’s a contribution to a living archive.

## 🔧 Setup Ritual

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/niaiengineering/cloud-ai-integration-training.git
   cd module-3-cloud-ai-orchestration

- Launch Devcontainer or Codespace
- Open in GitHub Codespaces or VS Code with Devcontainer support
- Confirm Python 3.10+ and AWS CLI are available
- Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


- Configure AWS Credentials
- Use aws configure or environment variables
- Ensure access to S3, Lambda, ECS, and API Gateway

📚 Invocation Walkthroughs
🔍 RAG with S3 Document Store
- Upload sample documents to S3 bucket genai-docs
- Use rag-s3-demo.ipynb t- o query via LangChain
- Annotate your queries with civic intent
“This document helps answer: How do we explain policy changes to customers with empathy?”


🤖 Agentic Flow via ECS Fargate
- Define agent behavior in agentic-flow-ecs.yaml
- Build and push container image to ECR
- Deploy to ECS Fargate and monitor logs
“This agent listens for claim events and responds with contextual guidance.”


🧠 MCP Server Invocation
- Use genai-invoke.py to trigger GenAI response via - Lambda + API Gateway
- Log invocation metadata for reproducibility
- Reflect on invocation patterns and edge cases
“Invocation #7 failed due to missing context—document this for future learners.”


🧵 Reproducibility Fingerprint
- Every script includes inline comments and version pinning
- Onboarding artifacts are modular and annotated
- Troubleshooting notes are embedded in README-troubleshooting.md
- All flows are documented with civic and emotional clarity

🌱 Legacy Stewardship Notes
- Use poetic annotations to honor contributors
- Maintain onboarding clarity for future maintainers
- Document edge cases and invocation failures
- Treat every script as a lantern for future learners

🎓 Completion Reflection
You’ve now orchestrated GenAI flows across AWS services.
Pause and ask:
What legacy have I just built?
Who will inherit this invocation ritual?
Welcome to the archive, steward.
