# Module 3: Cloud-AI Orchestration

## 🌟 Purpose
To guide learners in integrating GenAI capabilities into cloud-native workflows using AWS and Python, with reproducibility, modularity, and onboarding clarity.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Introduced

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- LangChain orchestration
- Agentic Flow design
- MCP Server invocation
- AWS Lambda, S3, ECS Fargate, API Gateway
- Reproducibility fingerprints and onboarding rituals

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1: Python Environment Setup
- Completion of Module 2: Python–Cloud Bridge
- Basic familiarity with AWS CLI and Python scripting

---

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the training repository  
2. Open in GitHub Codespaces or local devcontainer  
3. Install dependencies via `requirements.txt`  
4. Configure AWS credentials and environment variables  
5. Launch onboarding notebook: `genai-onboarding.ipynb`

## 🚀 Hands-On Exercises

### Exercise 1: RAG with S3 Document Store
- Upload sample documents to S3
- Use LangChain to query via RAG pipeline

### Exercise 2: Agentic Flow via ECS Fargate
- Define agent behavior in YAML
- Deploy containerized agent to ECS

### Exercise 3: MCP Server Invocation
- Trigger GenAI response via Lambda + API Gateway
- Log and analyze invocation patterns
