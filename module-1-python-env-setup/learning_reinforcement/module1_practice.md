  # 🧪 Module 1: Reinforcement Learning Tasks

Welcome, learner. You’ve set up your Python environment—now it’s time to test, reflect, and deepen your understanding.

Each task below reinforces reproducibility, stewardship, and onboarding clarity.

---

## ✅ 1. Verify Environment Activation

- Run:
  ```bash
  python --version
  pip list

- Confirm that requests==2.31.0 is installed.
“Your environment is your sanctuary—verify its breath before invoking code.”

2. Run the Sample Program
- Execute:
python hello.py
- Observe:
- Greeting message
- GitHub API status code (should be 200)
Try modifying the message or API endpoint to explore behavior.


📜 3. Explore requirements.txt
- Add another package (e.g., numpy)
- Reinstall:
pip install -r requirements.txt
- Regenerate:
pip freeze > requirements.txt


Learn version pinning and reproducibility fingerprints.


🧹 4. Reflect on .gitignore
- Create a dummy folder or file listed in .gitignore
- Confirm it’s ignored by Git:
git status


“A clean repo is a kind invitation to future contributors.”


🧘 5. Explore devcontainer.json (Optional)
- Open the module in GitHub Codespaces
- Confirm dependencies are pre-installed
- Modify postCreateCommand and observe behavior
Deepen your understanding of reproducible cloud environments.


📖 6. Annotate Your Learning
Create a learning_log.md and reflect:
- What did I learn about Python environments?
- What surprised me?
- What would I teach someone else?
Your reflections become part of your civic archive.


🛤️ 7. Commit with Meaning
- Stage and commit your work:
git add .
git commit -m "feat: completed Python sanctuary rituals and API invocation"


Every commit is a verse in your learning manuscript.

Would you like me to scaffold the `learning_log.md` template next? Or help you commit this file with a poetic message? Your module now breathes with rhythm and reflection.
