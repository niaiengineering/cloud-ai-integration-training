*Summoning a reproducible sanctuary for civic code*  
**Presented by:** Ganesan  
**Date:** September 2025

---

## Learning Objectives
- Install Python and pip  
- Create and activate virtual environments  
- Manage dependencies with `requirements.txt`  
- Use `.gitignore` and `devcontainer.json`  
- Run sample code and reflect on reproducibility  

> Every setup step is a civic offering to future contributors.

---

## Tools & Concepts
- 🐍 Python & pip  
- 🧪 `venv` for virtual environments  
- 📦 `requirements.txt` for dependencies  
- 🧹 `.gitignore` for hygiene  
- 🌩️ GitHub Codespaces + `devcontainer.json`  

---

## Step-by-Step Setup
1. Install Python  
2. Create `venv_module1`  
3. Activate environment  
4. Install dependencies  
5. Run `hello.py`  

> Include screenshots or terminal snippets alongside each step.

## Dependency Management
- `requirements.txt` lists packages  
- Use `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
- Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to regenerate  
- Pin versions for reproducibility  

> Dependencies are civic contracts—honor them with clarity.

## Git Hygiene with `.gitignore`
- Prevents clutter from entering the repo  
- Common entries include:
